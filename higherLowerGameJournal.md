# Journal

This is a journal of how I wrote this program, and what was my thought process. 

What is the problem?
Higher Lower Game in python. I will be comparing two people, things, or topics, and I would choose who is more famous. The winner topic will be compared to a new topic. When you get it right you score one point and if you make a mistake you lose a life. You have try lives, and if you run out of lives, game over. 

## Breakdown of the program.
 - The art - Done
 - data for comparison - 
 - asking the player to compare and vote
 - if right; update the score
 - if wrong; update the lives
 - remember the wining topic
 - compare it with a new topic
 - if wrong; the winning topic is the right topic for next comparison
